% Rochester Institute of Technology color scheme
%
% This uses the official RIT colors in HTML code found at:
%
%       https://www.rit.edu/upub/graphic-standards
%
% To use with Beamer, place this file in the same directory as your slides
% and add the following line AFTER your '\usetheme' command:
%
%       \usecolortheme{RIT}
%
% Alternatively, you could place this file in your Beamer theme directory,
% which would be somewhere like
%
%       /use/share/texmf-dist/tex/latex/beamer/themes/color/
%
% or something similarly obnoxious.
%
%
% NOTE:
%
% This color scheme was made with my personal favorite themes in mind, and
% thus it may not look as nice in certain other themes (i.e. I may have
% overlooked some color assignments). I believe it looks nice in
%
%     1. PaloAlto
%     2. Frankfurt
%     3. Madrid
%
% Feel free to modify anything you want.
