This repo contains an RIT color scheme for Beamer which can be used with any
theme, as well as an actual stand-alone theme based on the standard PaltoAlto
theme that comes with Beamer. The latter includes a convenience command for
using the RIT tiger logo in this repo, as well as a command for making
bold/orange header text.

In other words, make sure you're usage complies with the above. I was using it
for my thesis defense and conference slides, which was fine.
